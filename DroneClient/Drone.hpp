namespace DroneInterface {
	//VirtualStickMode has several different configuration settings that impact how each control is interpreted. We
	//only implement two combinations of settings, which we call Mode A and Mode B. Both of these modes attempt to
	//command the vehicle state in an absolute sense as much as possible (e.g. specifying height instead of vertical velocity)
	//but it is not possible to specify absolute 2D position in VirtualStickMode, so we specify 2D velocity in either the
	//vehicle body frame or in East-North. Because we are commanding velocity, we need to worry about what happens if our software
	//crashes - we certainly don't want the drones to keep moving with their last-commanded velocity. Thus, we include a timout
	//field for each virtual stick command. If another virtual stick command isn't received by the client App within the timeout
	//window, it should issue it's own new virtual stick command with the same values as the most recent received command except
	//with the 2D velocity fields set to 0. This way, commands also serve as a heartbeat signal from the GCS and if they stop coming,
	//the drones hover (without changing modes though).
	
	//To use a ModeA virtual stick command, the drone should be configured as follows:
	//DJIVirtualStickVerticalControlMode    = DJIVirtualStickVerticalControlModePosition
	//DJIVirtualStickRollPitchControlMode   = DJIVirtualStickRollPitchControlModeVelocity
	//DJIVirtualStickYawControlMode         = DJIVirtualStickYawControlModeAngle
	//DJIVirtualStickFlightCoordinateSystem = DJIVirtualStickFlightCoordinateSystemGround
	//In this mode, yaw is specified in an absolute sense, relative to North. Height is commanded in an absolute sense, relative to ground,
	//2D position is controlled by commanding vehicle velocity in the North and East directions
	struct VirtualStickCommand_ModeA {
		float Yaw;       //Radians: 0 corresponds to North, positive is clockwise rotation
		float V_North;   //m/s: North component of vehicle velocity (Acceptable range -15 to 15)
		float V_East;    //m/s: East component of vehicle velocity (Acceptable range -15 to 15)
		float HAG;       //m: Height above ground (vehicle altitude - takeoff altitude)
		float timeout;   //s: If a new command isn't received within this time, the drone should hover
		
		//If switching to C++20, default this
		bool operator==(VirtualStickCommand_ModeA const & Other) const {
			return (this->Yaw       == Other.Yaw)       &&
			       (this->V_North   == Other.V_North)   &&

	//DJIWaypointMissionGotoWaypointMode should be set to DJIWaypointMissionGotoWaypointPointToPoint. This means the vehicle goes directly from it's
